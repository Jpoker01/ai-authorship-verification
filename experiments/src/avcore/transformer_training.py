"""Training and scoring of the transformer classification heads, resumable after a crash.

A Kubernetes Job pod that is restarted runs the notebook from the top again. The trial that
was running is repeated with the same hyperparameters (tuning.py), and train_classifier
continues it from its last checkpoint instead of from the first step.
